Option chain aggregation was performed using R and converted into a script to be run daily.

**The option chain aggregation script is in daily_option_aggregation.R**

With the aggregated option chain data, a PyTorch neural network was model was developed to predict changes in stock price data from the aggregated option chain and supplementary data (e.g. Fed interest rate).

**The PyTorch neural network model development can be found in Revised_3yr_model_V4.ipynb**
